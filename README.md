## 1. Explain the main idea behind _Java_ and the concept of _Write Once, Run Anywhere_.
   Java is platform independent ,object-oriented programming language. 
1. Byte code - Java source code is complied into platform-independent byte code which can be executed by an JVM.
Java byte code can be executed on any device with a compatible JVM from smartphones to computer.
2. JVM- Java virtual machine has its own run time environment which executes byte code. JVM is platform dependent, because every
operating environment has its own JVM.
