## 1. Explain the main idea behind _Java_ and the concept of _Write Once, Run Anywhere_.
Java is platform independent ,object-oriented programming language. 
1. Byte code - Java source code is complied into platform-independent byte code which can be executed by an JVM.
Java byte code can be executed on any device with a compatible JVM from smartphones to computer.
2. JVM - Java virtual machine has its own run time environment which executes byte code. JVM is platform dependent, because every
operating environment has its own JVM. 



## 2. What are the main features of Java?
1. Platform Independent- Write once, run anywhere.
2. Object-Oriented- Emphasizes on classes and objects, therefore promoting OOPS concepts.
3. Secure - Java programs runs inside a virtual machine, therefore it's secure.


### 3. Difference between JDK, JVM and JRE?
The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the minimum environment required to execute a Java application.
JVM- 
1. JVM Interprets Java byte code into machine specific instructions
2. Memory Management - Handles memory management include garbage collection.
3. JIT compilation - Converts byte code to machine code.
4. Exception Handling - Manages exception handling.
